    Note that this also works in pure vanilla version.
  </details>
- <details>
    <summary>Supports custom attack sources;</summary>
    **Note** that the total number of attack sources (including the base 8) cannot exceed 32 due to game limitations.<br />

    - Add a name for a custom source to `TApp.dbf` and `TAppEdit.dbf`;
    - Add `NAME_TXT` (Character, size 10) and `IMMU_AI_R` (Numeric, size 2) columns to `LattS.dbf`;
    - Add a new entry in `LattS.dbf`;
    - Specify the custom source `ID` and `TEXT` accordingly;
    - Specify the id of the source name from `TApp.dbf` in `NAME_TXT` ('X005TA0153' for instance);
    - Specify `IMMU_AI_R`: AI rating of the source immunity - used to determine how powerful a unit with such ward or immunity is. The greater - the better. For example, elemental immunities have average rating of 5, while weapon immunity has 57. Can be omitted - 5 is the default;
    - Consider adding vertical align to unit encyclopedia fields to properly accommodate custom attack source text:
        - Find text constants with ids `X005TA0787` and `X005TA0788` in `TApp.dbf` and `TAppEdit.dbf`;
        - Note how attack name fields `%TWICE%%ALTATTACK%%ATTACK%%SECOND%` are enclosed in vertical align `\p110;` and `\p0;`;
        - Use the same technique to enclose `%SOURCE%%SOURCE2%` field in `X005TA0788` (like `\p110;%SOURCE%%SOURCE2%\p0;`);
        - Note that you can freely move content between `X005TA0787` and `X005TA0788` if you run out of length limit (because the two strings simply merged together in `X005TA0424`).

    **Note** that the `SOURCE` column is limited to 1 digit in `GAttacks.dbf`.<br />
    This means that only 2 additional sources (with id 8 and 9) can be added by default.<br />
    The limit can be lifted by extending the `SOURCE` column size to 2 digits (similar to `CLASS`).<br />
    For example, using Sdbf: go to main manu Table > Change structure, set `SOURCE` size to 2 and hit save:

    [Scripts](Scripts) includes example targeting scripts demonstrated in the video above.<br />
    [Examples](Examples) includes an example of LAttR.dbf.<br />
    [luaApi](luaApi.md) contains a complete script Api reference to help you create your own scripts.<br />

    Additional columns of LAttR.dbf:
    - `REACH_TXT` (Character, size 10) specifies an id for 'Reach' encyclopedia description from `TApp.dbf` and `TAppEdit.dbf`. For example 'X005TA0201' is the standard 'Adjacent units';
    - `TARGET_TXT` (Character, size 10) is similar to `REACH_TXT` but for 'Targets' entry (either '1' or '6' in vanilla);
    - `SEL_SCRIPT` (Character, size 48) contains a file name of a targeting script from [Scripts](Scripts). The script determines which units allowed to be **selected** for attack;
    - `ATT_SCRIPT` (Character, size 48) is similar to `SEL_SCRIPT`, but determines which units will be **affected** by attack;
    - `MRK_TARGTS` (Logical) determines whether `ATT_SCRIPT` should be used to also mark targets with circle animation on battlefield. Usually should be **true**, except when the attack affects random targets (`L_CHAIN` for instance);
    - `MAX_TARGTS` (Numeric, size 1) specifies maximum number of targets that can be affected by attack. Used for AI rating calculations, and for damage ratio display formatting in unit encyclopedia;
    - `MELEE` (Logical) determines whether the attack considered as melee. Used by AI for unit hiring, positioning and targeting;
    - Consider adding vertical align to unit encyclopedia fields to properly accommodate custom attack reach text:
        - Find text constants with ids `X005TA0787` and `X005TA0788` in `TApp.dbf` and `TAppEdit.dbf`;
        - Note how attack name fields `%TWICE%%ALTATTACK%%ATTACK%%SECOND%` are enclosed in vertical align `\p110;` and `\p0;`;
        - Use the same technique to enclose `%REACH%` and `%TARGETS%` fields in `X005TA0788` (like `\p110;%REACH%\p0;`);
        - Note that you can freely move content between `X005TA0787` and `X005TA0788` if you run out of length limit (because the two strings simply merged together in `X005TA0424`).

    Example descriptions for `TARGET_TXT`:
    ```
    X005TA1000 All adjacent units
    X005TA1001 The target and all units adjacent to it
    X005TA1002 The target and one unit adjacent to it
    X005TA1003 All units in the adjacent line
    X005TA1004 The target and the unit behind it
    X005TA1005 The target and the unit behind it
    X005TA1006 All units in the target line
    X005TA1007 All units in the target column
    X005TA1008 All units in 2x2 area
    X005TA1009 Randomly bounces to 2 additional targets
    X005TA1010 The target and one random unit
    ```

    **Note** that the `REACH` column is limited to 1 digit in `GAttacks.dbf`.<br />
    This means that only 6 additional reaches (id 4-9) can be added by default.<br />
    The limit can be lifted by extending the `REACH` column size to 2 digits (similar to `CLASS`).<br />
    For example, using Sdbf: go to main manu Table > Change structure, set `REACH` size to 2 and hit save:

    <summary>Supports custom attack damage ratios for additional targets;</summary>

    The main purpose is to complement custom attack reaches.<br />
    Allows to reduce or increase incoming damage for additional attack targets:
    - Add `DAM_RATIO` (Numeric, size 3), `DR_REPEAT` (Logical) and `DAM_SPLIT` (Logical) columns to `Gattacks.dbf`;
    - `DAM_RATIO` specifies a portion of the attack damage received by additional targets (0-255%). 100 or empty is the vanilla behavior;
    - `DR_REPEAT` specifies whether the `DAM_RATIO` should be applied for every consequent target;
    - `DAM_SPLIT` specifies whether the attack damage (`QTY_DAM`) is split between all the affected targets;
    - `splitDamageMultiplier` in [settings.lua](Scripts/settings.lua) specifies multiplier for `DAM_SPLIT` damage for better late-game scaling (default of 300 max damage split among 6 targets is miserable);
    - Specify the following interface text ids in [textids.lua](Scripts/textids.lua):
        - `ratedDamage`
        - `ratedDamageEqual`
        - `ratedDamageSeparator`
        - `splitDamage`
    - Add the specified interface text to `TApp.dbf` and `TAppEdit.dbf`;
    - Consider adding vertical align to unit encyclopedia fields to properly accommodate damage ratio text:
        - Find text constants with ids `X005TA0787` and `X005TA0788` in `TApp.dbf` and `TAppEdit.dbf`;
        - Note how attack name fields `%TWICE%%ALTATTACK%%ATTACK%%SECOND%` are enclosed in vertical align `\p110;` and `\p0;`;
        - Use the same technique to enclose `%DAMAGE%` field in `X005TA0788` (like `\p110;%DAMAGE%\p0;`);
        - Note that you can freely move content between `X005TA0787` and `X005TA0788` if you run out of length limit (because the two strings simply merged together in `X005TA0424`).

    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5180699/124194976-2b565e80-dad2-11eb-8395-58614dcd669f.png)

    How `DR_REPEAT` works:
    - For instance, if `QTY_DAM` = 50 and `DAM_RATIO` = 20, then the first target receives 50, second - 10 (50 * 0,2), third - 2 (10 * 0,2) and so on.

    How `DAM_SPLIT` works:
    - For instance, if `QTY_DAM` = 100 and there are 3 affected targets, then every target will receive 33 damage;
    - `DAM_RATIO` and `DR_REPEAT` also apply, but determine a ratio between additional and first target damage. For instance, if `QTY_DAM` = 100, `DAM_RATIO` = 25 and there are 3 affected targets then the damage distribution will be 67-17-17 (67 * 0,25 ~ 17; 67 + 17 + 17 ~ 100).
    
    How `splitDamageMultiplier` works:
    - For instance, if the multiplier is 6 and unit attack damage is 300, then its final damage will be 300 * 6 = 1800;
    - Take the multiplier into account when picking base values for `QTY_DAM` in `Gattacks.dbf` along with `DAMAGE` in `GDynUpgr.dbf`;
    - The multiplied damage is correctly displayed in unit encyclopedia.

    [luaApi](luaApi.md) contains a complete script Api reference to help you create your own scripts.<br />
    **Note** that Bestow Wards attack does not reset wards granted by custom modifiers (because the attack cannot predict the behavior of your custom script). Use standard modifiers for this purpose.<br />

    - Add `L_CUSTOM` category to `LModifS.dbf` or simply copy the file from [Examples](Examples);
    - Add `SCRIPT` (Character, size 40) column to `Gmodif.dbf`;
    - Add `DESC_TXT` (Character, size 10) column to `Gmodif.dbf`;
    - Add `DISPLAY` (Logical) column to `Gmodif.dbf`;
    - (Optional) Setup modifiers panel for Unit Encyclopedia:
        - Include `LBOX_MODIFIERS` and `TXT_MODIFIERS` elements to `Interf.dlg` and `ScenEdit.dlg`. [Interf.dlg](Examples/Modifiers/Interf.dlg) and [ScenEdit.dlg](Examples/Modifiers/ScenEdit.dlg) contain examples of modified `DLG_R_C_UNIT` dialog of Unit Encyclopedia;
        - Note that the examples intentionally hide or reposition some native elements: 'Leader abilities', 'Leadership', 'Battles won', locked-unit / upgrade-needed indicators;
        - Try extending the dialog bounds or otherwise rearrange its elements to properly accomodate all the available elements as you like;
        - Specify the following interface text ids in [textids.lua](Scripts/textids.lua):
            - `modifiersCaption`
            - `modifiersEmpty`
            - `modifierDescription`
            - `nativeModifierDescription`
        - Add the specified interface text to `TApp.dbf` and `TAppEdit.dbf`.
    - (Optional) Add a new modifier description and icon (it will be displayed in Scenario Editor and Unit Encyclopedia):
        - Create a description in `Tglobal.dbf`. You can use rich formatting like `\fMedBold;Born Leader\n\fSmall;+1 leadership every 3 levels.\fNormal;`;
        - Create `31x36px` icon in `Icons.ff` (using special software like `D2ResExplorer`). **Its name should correspond to modifier id** to be linked with it (similar to spell icons and other game resources), like `G000UM9048`;
    - Add a new modifier entry in `Gmodif.dbf` (see example [Gmodif.dbf](Examples/Modifiers/Gmodif.dbf)):
        - Specify new `MODIF_ID` (use format `gXXXum9XXX` if you want it to be available as Scenario Editor modifier);
        - Specify `SOURCE` id that corresponds to `L_CUSTOM` category added earlier (example `LModifS.dbf` uses `4` as the id);
        - Specify `SCRIPT` file name that will be used for this modifier (omit file path, for example `berserk.lua`);
        - (Optional) Specify `DESC_TXT` id that corresponds to `Tglobal.dbf` entry added earlier (defaults to the standard stub `x000tg6000`);
        - (Optional) Specify `DISPLAY` that controls whether the modifier should appear in modifiers panel for Unit Encyclopedia (defaults to false);
    - Refer to [Scripts/Modifiers](Scripts/Modifiers) examples and [luaApi](luaApi.md) to create your modifier script;
    - (Optional) Define dynamic display functions inside your modifier script to control its appearance on modifiers panel depending on a current unit:
        - Specify `getModifierDisplay(unit, prev)` function to enable or disable modifier display (defaults to `DISPLAY` in `Gmodif.dbf`);
        - Specify `getModifierDescTxt(unit, prev)` function to redefine modifier description (defaults to `DESC_TXT` in `Gmodif.dbf`);
        - Specify `getModifierIconName(unit, prev)` function to redefine modifier icon (defaults to `MODIF_ID` in `Gmodif.dbf`);
        - See [template.lua](Scripts/Modifiers/template.lua) for examples.
    - Try assigning the created modifier to item, potion or spell, or simply use it as Scenario Editor modifier;
    - Consider adding vertical align to unit encyclopedia fields to properly accommodate custom modifier bonuses text:
        - Find text constants with ids `X005TA0787` and `X005TA0788` in `TApp.dbf` and `TAppEdit.dbf`;
        - Note how attack name fields `%TWICE%%ALTATTACK%%ATTACK%%SECOND%` are enclosed in vertical align `\p110;` and `\p0;`;

    <summary>Supports native unit modifiers;</summary>
    
    Allows to assign 'native' modifiers to unit types.<br />
    That is, a modifier will be permanently applied to all units of the specified type - existing in a scenario or newly created / hired.<br />
    When unit changes its type (transforms or upgrades), modifiers native to its previous type are automatically removed, and new modifiers that are native to the new type are applied.<br />
    Native modifiers are not stored in scenario file, thus you can freely manipulate it without scenario file being affected in any way.
    - Copy [GUmodif.dbf](Examples/Modifiers/GUmodif.dbf) to 'Globals' directory;
    - `UNIT_ID` specifies id of a unit from `GUnits.dbf`. Use empty id (`g000000000`) if you want a modifier to be applied to **every single unit, note it impacts performance so try to avoid this if its not necessary**;
    - `MODIF_1`, `MODIF_2`, ..., `MODIF_N` specifies modifier id from `Gmodif.dbf`. In can be either standard or custom modifier.
